	<h1>SUPERBOWL LVII 2023</h1>
	<h2>TEXT</h2>
	<p><strong>The</strong> scoring started fast and furious, with Philadelphia striking first after Kansas City won the coin toss and deferred.Jalen Hurts hit wideout DeVonta Smith three times for 41 yards, added an 11-yard run of his own and appeared to hand off to Kenneth Gainwell for a touchdown. The gritty running back fell just short of the end zone, though, and a review negated the score.No score, no problem for the NFC champions, though, as Philly did what it has done so many times this season: shoved Hurts for a yard, this one resulting in six and the Eagles' first lead of the game.</p>

	<div>
	<p><blockquote><em><strong>Head</strong> coach Andy Reid's decision to stay conservative and try for a field goal backfired as Harrison Butker continued a subpar year by doinking a 42-yarder off the left upright, canceling the first (and only) opportunity the Chiefs had to take a lead in the first half.It was a decision that had the commentary team of Kevin Burkhardt and Greg Olsen questioning the Kansas City head coach in short order.</em></blockquote></p>

	<p><strong>It</strong> was a masterful performance by Mahomes and the Chiefs coordinators in the second half, on both sides of the ball. They made the necessary changes to put the team in a position to succeed and that can be attributed to experience, leadership and unwavering confidence from the quarterback in his ability to win when the pressure was on. A classic game, with the type of performance that legacies are built on. Unfortunately for Hurts, his excellence comes on the losing end of things. If he can sustain this level of play, though, it won't be the last time he has the opportunity to star on this stage.</p>
